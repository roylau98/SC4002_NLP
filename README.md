## Setup instructions

The following instructions setups a new virtual environment for python and installs the needed libraries.  
These instructions assumes that the user is using a Windows machine. Ensure that Python 3.11 is installed as well.

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

If the host machine that is running the code has a GPU with cuda you can install torch with cuda support instead 
using the command given in the PyTorch documentation https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
